            <div class="description">
                <p>Lord Edmund Blackwood was a formidable presence in both Yorkshire society and British industry. His steel works employed over 800 men and supplied railways across the Empire. Known for his iron will and business acumen, he was equally renowned for his tyrannical control over his family.</p>
                
                <p>Edmund maintained strict authority over his household. He arranged his daughter's engagement without her consent, monitored his son's finances with ruthless scrutiny, and maintained what many described as a cold, loveless marriage. His household staff feared him, though they respected his consistency and fairness in employment matters.</p>
                
                <p>In recent months, Edmund had been consuming various "health tonics" purchased from apothecaries, believing they improved his vigor. This habit would prove fatal, as it masked early symptoms of poisoning that might otherwise have alerted him to danger.</p>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <strong>NOTE:</strong> Post-mortem revealed Edmund had been ingesting small amounts of arsenic over several days prior to the fatal dose, likely mixed into his daily tonic regimen.

                <p>Lady Catherine married Edmund Blackwood in 1864 in what was largely considered a strategic alliance between families. The marriage produced two children but little affection.

                <p>In 1885, Catherine moved to separate quarters, claiming health concerns required solitude. Edmund permitted this arrangement with apparent indifference. Since then, Catherine has spent much time with her personal physician, Dr. Helena Ashworth, who visits the estate frequently to treat Catherine's "nervous condition."</p>
                
                <p>Catherine is well-educated, cultured, and maintains correspondence with literary society in London. She reads extensively and has developed a particular interest in medicinal herbs and compounds, keeping a private collection of botanical texts.</p>

                <p>Victor Blackwood is Edmund's only son and was groomed from birth to inherit the family business. However, Victor showed little aptitude or interest in industrial management, preferring the social life of London to the grim realities of the steel works.</p>
                
                <p>Edmund maintained tight control over Victor's finances, providing only a modest allowance despite the family's considerable wealth. This led Victor to seek funds elsewhere, resulting in substantial gambling debts. Recent months have seen increasingly desperate attempts to secure loans.</p>
                
                <p>Victor's relationship with his father deteriorated significantly in 1888 when Edmund discovered Victor had forged a check. Edmund threatened disinheritance but ultimately relented, instead imposing even stricter financial controls. Victor was required to visit the estate quarterly for "accountability reviews" that household staff described as brutal interrogations.</p>

                <p>In September 1889, Edmund arranged Constance's engagement to Lord Reginald Thornbury, a man 35 years her senior and known for his cruel temperament. Constance pleaded against the match, but Edmund dismissed her objections as "feminine hysteria." The wedding was set for December 1889.</p>
                
                <p>Since the engagement announcement, Constance has become increasingly withdrawn. Servants report hearing her crying late at night and have witnessed several emotional confrontations with her father. She spends hours in the estate library and has been observed reading medical texts.</p>
