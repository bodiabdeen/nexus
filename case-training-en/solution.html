                <h3>📋 CASE SUMMARY</h3>
                <p>Marcus Webb, the IT Administrator at TechStart Inc., orchestrated and executed the theft of David Park's laptop containing $2.5 million worth of proprietary AI software. The theft was carefully premeditated, with Marcus planning the crime at least one week in advance by scheduling security camera maintenance to create a surveillance blind spot.</p>
                
                <p>On January 15, 2024, at 2:45 PM, Marcus used his administrative privileges to unlock David Park's office while David was away. He spent approximately 7 minutes inside the office, during which he took the MacBook Pro and placed it in his IT toolkit. He then left the building at 2:55 PM, appearing nervous to the security guard, and placed the toolkit in his car trunk.</p>

                <p>The stolen laptop was recovered from Marcus Webb's vehicle on January 16, 2024, providing indisputable physical evidence of his guilt. Phone records also revealed that Marcus contacted TechVenture Capital, a competing company, immediately after the theft, indicating his intention to sell the stolen software.</p>

                <h4>❌ WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT</h4>

                <div class="innocent-person">
                    <h5>Lisa Chen - Marketing Manager</h5>
                    <p><strong>Why she's innocent:</strong> While Lisa was present in the hallway and had a motive (needed software specs for her presentation), she lacks the technical means to execute the theft. She has no administrative access to unlock offices, and witness testimony shows she left immediately when Marcus arrived. She may have been involved as a lookout or accomplice, but she did not physically steal the laptop. Most importantly, the laptop was found in Marcus's possession, not hers. At worst, she was complicit, but Marcus was the primary perpetrator.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="innocent-person">
                    <h5>Sarah Miller - Chief Financial Officer</h5>
                    <p><strong>Why she's innocent:</strong> Sarah had strong financial motive (wanted David's project to fail to save budget) and was unaccounted for during the theft window. However, she has no technical knowledge, no administrative building access, and no means to unlock David's office. Her assistant's testimony about her absence is suspicious, but there's no physical evidence connecting her to the theft. The laptop was found in Marcus's possession. Sarah may have harbored ill will toward David, but she didn't commit the theft.</p>

            <div class="section">
                <h3>⚖️ CONCLUSION</h3>
                <p><strong>Marcus Webb is guilty beyond reasonable doubt.</strong> He had motive (financial gain through selling to competitors), means (administrative access and technical knowledge), and opportunity (scheduled camera blackout and legitimate access to the office). The physical evidence - the laptop found in his possession - conclusively proves his guilt.</p>

                <p>Marcus carefully planned this theft at least one week in advance, demonstrating premeditation. He created a surveillance blind spot, fabricated a work order as cover, and immediately contacted a competitor to sell the stolen intellectual property. His nervous behavior when leaving the building and the discovery of the laptop in his vehicle seal his conviction.</p>

                <p><strong>Recommended charges:</strong> Theft of intellectual property, computer fraud, corporate espionage, and attempted sale of stolen trade secrets.</p>
